The provided script appears to be a Google Apps Script that interacts with a GraphQL API to fetch data from an AIESEC system and manipulate it within Google Sheets. The `dataExtraction` function prepares a GraphQL query and makes a POST request to retrieve data based on given parameters. The `dataManipulation` function processes the fetched data, formats it, and either adds new rows or updates existing ones in a specified sheet. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process by defining queries, calling data extraction and manipulation functions, and handling errors and updates in the Google Sheets interface sheet. Additional functions like `updateECBChecks` and `updateBreaks` manage specific updates and modifications within the sheet based on external data sources. This script essentially automates data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tasks between the AIESEC system and Google Sheets for tracking opportunities and applications.
